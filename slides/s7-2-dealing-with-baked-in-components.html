<h2>Dealing With Baked-In Components</h2>

<p>In our example, the Navigation component is a Baked-In component in that it is statically included as part of the page's .jsp and not via an authored addition through a paragraph system. As such, when a page is created, no content node is created in the JCR representing the instance of the Navigation component until the component is edited.</p>

<p>Dependencies for baked in components can be added as dependencies of the template's page component, or the template can be setup such that content nodes for the baked in components are created upon instantiation of a template.</p>
