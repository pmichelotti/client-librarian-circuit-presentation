<h2>The Core Problem</h2>

<p>When requesting a library, what is being requested is a particular Client Library by category.  This library is completely agnostic of its context, that is, the page for which the request 
	is being made.  This means that the creation of the library is not specific to the needs of the page.</p>

<aside class="notes">
    There is not necessarily a &quot;Problem&quot; to be solved here - but a limitation to be overcome.  Throughout the presentation I intend to show why library-based requesting of client side 
    libraries is a limitation and what can be accomplished once this limitation is overcome.
