    The library dependencies of a particular page are determined by an implementation of the DependencyProvider interface

    The default implementation provided with the Librarian looks to the resources which are descendents of the current page and, given the sling:resourceType where defined, looks up the dependencies in the component definition associated with the resource type

    Any number of custom implementations may be provided by creating OSGI service implementations of the DependencyProvider interface.

    When determining page dependencies, all available dependency providers are polled to see if they know of dependencies for the page in question.

    Use cases might include Determining additional Dependencies based on Page property values and Determining additional dependencies based on Design properties
