<h2>Content Centric Page Layout and Behavior</h2>

<p>A page may be typed in both apperance and behavior based on its content.  For example, a Recipe page is a Recipe page by the virtue of the fact that it has a Recipe component on it and not because it uses a particular template.</p>

<div style="text-align : center;">
	<img src="slides/a-recipe-page.png" style="max-height : 80%;" />
</div>
