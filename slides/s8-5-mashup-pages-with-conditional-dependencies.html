<h2>Mashup Pages With Conditional Dependencies</h2>

<p>A Conditional Dependency indicates that, while the library does not necessarily depend on the conditional dependency, when both the library and its conditional dependency are included in the same composed library, and conditional dependencies are to be ordered prior to the conditionally dependent library.</p>

<p>This opens the door to interesting style and behavior mashups.  Consider a Recipe and Product page mashup created by an author dragging both a Recipe component and a Product component onto a page.  With a bit of planning in your CSS and JavaScript, the style and behavior of such a page could be completely different from a Recipe page or a Product page and can be made consistent via the use of Conditional Dependencies.</p>
