## Composite Runmodes

Composite runmodes may be used to build up more complex inclusion rules for libraries.  

The below runModes configuration will cause the attributed library to be included if Sling is running in runmodes "a" and "b" or in runmodes "c" and "d". 

```
runModes = "[a.b,c.d]"
```
