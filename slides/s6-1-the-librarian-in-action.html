<h2>The Librarian in Action</h2>

<p>The Client Librarian will compose a library out of the dependencies it can find for a given page.  The default mechanism for finding dependencies is via inspection of the component instances present on a page.  As such, once we start adding components with library dependencies to a page, the Librarian will be able to build up a library specific to the components on the page. </p>

    How things are setup currently in our example, prior to components being added to the page, the page specific JavaScript and CSS libraries will be empty.
