<h2>Example Client Library Setup</h2>

<p>A particular library can be requested by category using the cq:includeClientLib tag.  This tag produces, among other thins, script and link HTML tags necessary for 
	inclusion of the aggregate JavaScript and CSS libraries.</p>

<aside class="notes">
    In our example, we might include a request for the &quot;myapp.main&quot; category.  This category embeds the &quot;myapp.jquery&quot;, &quot;myapp.bootstrap&quot;, and &quot;myapp.components&quot; 
    categories.  Thus, an inclusion of the library answering to the &quot;myapp.main&quot; category includes our global libraries and our component-specific libraries.
